# Photon iMessage

Connect Hermes to iMessage through [Photon][photon] and the Photon Spectrum SDK.

## Architecture

Photon uses a single Hermes-owned adapter boundary:

```text
Photon Spectrum SDK
  -> plugins/platforms/photon/adapter.py
  -> Hermes gateway MessageEvent / SendResult
```

The Python adapter owns Hermes behavior: inbound event normalization, sender
authorization, `MessageEvent` creation, outbound payload construction,
`SendResult` mapping, health/status, and current-home runtime state.

The Spectrum SDK currently runs from a private Node sidecar because the
SDK is TypeScript-based. Hermes starts that sidecar over stdio from
`adapter.py`; it is not a public server and does not expose local or public HTTP
endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- A Photon account at [app.photon.codes][app].
- Node.js 20.18.1 or newer on PATH, or `PHOTON_NODE_BIN` pointing at Node.
- A phone number in E.164 format, such as `+15105550123`.

## First-Time Setup

```bash
hermes photon setup +15105550123
```

Setup always uses the Photon dashboard project name `hermes-agent`. You do not
choose a project name.

Setup will:

- validate or run Photon dashboard login
- find or create the fixed `hermes-agent` project
- store Spectrum project credentials for the current Hermes home
- find or create the operator phone user
- seed `PHOTON_HOME_CHANNEL=any;-;+E164` and
  `PHOTON_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME=You (iMessage)` when unset
- authorize the operator phone for Hermes gateway access
- install sidecar dependencies when needed
- enable `platforms.photon.enabled=true`

`PHOTON_OPERATOR_PHONE` and `PHOTON_ASSIGNED_PHONE_NUMBER` are last-setup/status
metadata. They are not used to route replies and are not the multi-phone source
of truth. Photon replies are sent back to the inbound Spectrum space, while
runtime authorization is controlled by `PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS` and
`PHOTON_ALLOW_ALL_USERS`.

Setup preserves any existing `PHOTON_HOME_CHANNEL`, so custom cron/proactive
delivery targets are not overwritten. With the seeded operator DM, cron jobs and
other proactive sends can use `deliver=photon`; if cron is running outside the
gateway process, Hermes starts a private send-once sidecar that does not consume
the inbound Spectrum stream.

After setup, start or restart the Hermes gateway. The gateway loads
`plugins/platforms/photon/adapter.py`, and the adapter starts the private SDK
sidecar and subscribes to inbound Spectrum events.

Outbound media is supported through the same `MEDIA:/path/to/file` mechanism as
other Hermes messaging platforms. Photon sends images, audio/voice files,
videos, and documents through Spectrum attachment content. Inbound attachments
are read from Spectrum's SDK content accessors, cached under the current Hermes
home, and routed through the normal image, audio, video, and document pipelines.
If the SDK cannot materialize the bytes, Hermes still shows a metadata marker
with the filename and MIME type.

Only one Hermes gateway process can stream a given Photon Spectrum project at a
time. If Photon status reports that the project is already in use, stop the
other gateway first, then start this gateway again. Send-once delivery for
`deliver=photon` does not take this lock because it only sends one outbound
message.

## Commands

```bash
hermes photon login
hermes photon setup +15105550123
hermes photon phones list
hermes photon phones add +15105550124
hermes photon phones remove +15105550124
hermes photon status
hermes photon reset
hermes photon reset --all
```

`hermes photon allow-phone <phone>` remains a low-level local authorization
command. It only edits Hermes sender access and does not create a Photon project
user, so prefer `hermes photon phones add <phone>` for multi-phone setup.

## Phone Management

```bash
hermes photon phones list
hermes photon phones add +15105550124
hermes photon phones remove +15105550124
```

`phones list` shows every active phone/user configured on the fixed
`hermes-agent` Photon project, including submitted phone, assigned
Photon/iMessage number when known, user ID, and Hermes authorization state.

`phones add` creates the Photon project user first, then appends the phone to
`PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS`. If the phone already exists on the Photon project, the
command fails clearly and does not duplicate local authorization state.

`phones remove` removes the Photon project user first, then removes the phone
from `PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS`. If the phone does not exist on the Photon project,
the command fails clearly and does not modify local authorization state.

When `PHOTON_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true`, access remains open even after removing a
phone from `PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS`; `phones list` and `status` make that visible.

## Status

```bash
hermes photon status
```

Status shows:

- current Hermes home and env path
- dashboard login state
- Spectrum credential validity
- fixed project name and project ID
- operator phone
- assigned Photon/iMessage number when Photon returns one
- home channel and home channel label
- concise phones summary
- sidecar dependency state
- adapter runtime health
- authorized sender state
- next step

The adapter runtime state is stored under the current Hermes home:

```text
<HERMES_HOME>/photon/adapter-runtime.json
```

If status says the adapter is not running after setup, start or restart the
gateway.

## Environment

Setup manages the primary values:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` | Spectrum project ID. |
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_SECRET` | Spectrum project secret. |
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_NAME` | Always `hermes-agent` for setup. |
| `PHOTON_OPERATOR_PHONE` | Operator phone passed to setup. |
| `PHOTON_ASSIGNED_PHONE_NUMBER` | Assigned Photon/iMessage number, when known. |
| `PHOTON_ALLOWED_USERS` | Authorized senders. |
| `PHOTON_HOME_CHANNEL` | Default proactive target, usually `any;-;+E164`. |
| `PHOTON_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME` | Human label, seeded as `You (iMessage)`. |

Optional values:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PHOTON_NODE_BIN` | Node binary override. |
| `PHOTON_API_HOST` | Spectrum API host override. |
| `PHOTON_DASHBOARD_HOST` | Dashboard API host override. |
| `PHOTON_ALLOW_ALL_USERS` | Development-only sender allowlist bypass. |

## Reset

```bash
hermes photon reset
hermes photon reset --all
```

`reset` clears local Photon project/runtime identity for the current Hermes
home. `reset --all` also clears the Photon dashboard login token after
confirmation.

Neither command deletes Photon dashboard projects or users.
